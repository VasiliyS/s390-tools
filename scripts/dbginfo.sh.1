.SH NAME
dbginfo.sh \- collect runtime, configuration and trace information
for debugging Linux on IBM Z

.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
\fBdbginfo.sh\fP [OPTIONS]
.br
\fBdbginfo.sh\fP {\-h|\-v}

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script collects runtime, configuration and trace information that can
be used to debug a Linux on IBM Z instance.
For Linux on z/VM, the script also traces information about the z/VM system.
The debug information is written to a file
/tmp/DBGINFO\-<date>\-<time>\-<hostname>\-<processorid>.tgz
where [date] and [time] are the date and time when the debug data was
collected. [hostname] indicates the hostname of the system the data was
collected from. The [processorid] is taken from the processor 0 and indicates
the processor identification.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
\fB\-d <DIRECTORY>\fP, \fB\-\-directory <DIRECTORY>\fP
Specify the DIRECTORY where the data collection stores the temporary data and the final archive. The specified directory must already exist. If this parameter is not specified, /tmp is used by default.

.SH FILES
A .tgz file of the form
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    DBGINFO\-<year>\-<month>\-<day>\-<hours>\-<minutes>\-<seconds>\-<hostname>\-<processorid>.tgz

.fam T
.fi
is generated and placed in the /tmp directory or in the directory specified by the -d option.
