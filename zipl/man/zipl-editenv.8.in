.SH NAME
zipl-editenv \- zIPL environment editor.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zipl-editenv
[OPTION] [ARGUMENT]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zipl-editenv
is a tool to manipulate with zIPL environment of partitions, prepared for
initial program load (IPL) by
.B zipl(8)
utility. This tool performs atomic updates of boot data without modifying the
boot record referencing that data. The following operations are supported:
.IP "     -"
Print environment
.IP "     -"
Assign a specified value to any environment variable
.IP "     -"
Remove a specified variable from the environment
.IP "     -"
Remove all variables from the environment
.PP

.B zIPL environment
(don't confuse with shell environment!) is a method of evaluation of zIPL
environment variables, which is used at boot time. Names of zIPL environment
variables have to satisfy POSIX requirements for shell environment variables
(IEEE Std 1003.1-2001). That is, such names should consist solely of uppercase
letters, digits, and underscores ('_') from the characters defined in Portable
Character Set and should not begin with a digit.

zIPL environment is defined per boot partition by a special boot component
called
.B zIPL environment block.
This component is used for evaluation of zIPL environment variables present
in another boot component, kernel command line, where the mentioned variables
have to be specified by their names as ${NAME}. During boot, such variables
are replaced with values, as defined by the active namespace in the installed
environment block.

zIPL environment is installed every time when preparing a device for initial
program load (IPL) by
.B zipl(8)
utility. At installation time the environment by default is imported from
user-editable file
.B '/etc/ziplenv'.
That default location can be overridden by respective
.B zipl(8)
option.

Installed zIPL environment (AKA zIPL environment block) can be accessed
(modified, printed) by this
.B zipl-editenv(8)
tool. All modifications made with this tool don't affect the file
.B '/etc/ziplenv'.
Hence, those modifications will be lost after the next boot record
re-installation, unless
.B '/etc/ziplenv'
was updated respectively.

At boot time any zIPL environment variable can be evaluated by different
preinstalled ways. An individual method of evaluation of all environment
variables is called an
.B environment namespace.
zIPL supports 10 identified namespaces called
.B sites
and one so-called
.B common
(or default) namespace per boot partition.
Maximum number of values defined by all installed namespaces is 512.
Sites are identified by positive integer numbers from 0 to 9.
In contrast with sites, common namespace doesn't have any identifier.
User can set anyone of the installed site namespaces to be used for
evaluation of zIPL environment variables (in the kernel command line)
at boot time. This operation is also called
.B namespace activation.
Namespace can be activated either "in advance" by
.B chreipl(8)
utility for the next boot session, or directly at boot time by the boot
command. In both ways ID of the active site should be properly encoded
in the LOADPARM. If no site ID is identified in the LOADPARM, then the
common namespace gets activated.
If some variable is missed (undefined) in the active namespace, then it
gets evaluated by the common namespace. If some variable is missed in
both, active and common namespaces, then it gets removed from the command
line by the boot process.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-v" " or " "\-\-version"
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-t <TARGET DIRECTORY>" " or " "\-\-target <TARGET DIRECTORY>"
Specify a directory, where the environment is installed. This directory should
contain boot data (bootmap file). If this option is not specified, then the
tool assumes that the environment is installed in  "/boot". A similar option
with the same name exists also for
.B zipl(8)
utility.

.TP
.BR "\-l" " or " "\-\-list"
Prints a list of zIPL environment variables with their values as found in the
installed environment block.

In a combination with the option -S (--site) it prints only values defined in
the respective site namespace.
In a combination with the option -E (--effective-site) it prints the way of
evaluation of zIPL environment variables that would take place, if the
specified site was encoded in the LOADPARM for the boot session.
By default it simply dumps all the installed namespaces.

.TP
.BR "\-s <NAME=VALUE>" " or " "\-\-set <NAME=VALUE>"
Assign
.B VALUE
to the variable
.B NAME.
.B NAME
has to satisfy the requirements above.
.B VALUE
may consist of any printable characters different from the new line symbol.
If variable with such name didn't exist in the environment,
then it will be added.
In a combination with the option -S (--site) the value is assigned in the
specified namespace. By default - in the common namespace.
.TP
.BR "\-u <NAME>" " or " "\-\-unset <NAME>"
Remove the variable with name
.B NAME
from zIPL environment.
In a combination with the option -S (--site) the variable gets removed from
the specified namespace. By default - from the common namespace.
.TP
.BR "\-r" " or " "\-\-reset"
Remove all variables from zIPL environment.
In a combination with the option -S (--site) the variables get removed only
from the specified site. By default - from all namespaces.
.TP
.BR "\-S" " or " "\-\-site <SITE_ID>"
Specifies a particular site namespace to operate on. Can be used in a
combination with options \-s (\-\-set), \-u (\-\-unset), -r (\-\-reset) and
\-l (\-\-list).
This option makes the tool operate on a specified namespace only.
Specifically, when using in a combination with \-s, \-u, or -r, changes are
applied only to the specified namespace. When using in a combination with
\-l, only specified namespace is displayed.
.B SITE_ID
is a site identifier - any decimal positive number from 0 till 9.
.TP
.BR "\-E" " or " "\-\-effective\-site <SITE_ID>"
When using in a combination with option \-l (\-\-list), it displays the way
of evaluation of zIPL environment variables that would take place, if the
specified site was activated for the boot session.
.B SITE_ID
is a site identifier - any decimal positive number from 0 till 9.

.SH FILES

.B /etc/ziplenv
- "initial environment" (or "environment file").

A regular file containing zIPL environment to be installed every time when
preparing a device for initial program load (IPL) by
.B zipl(8)
utility.
Don't confuse environment file with environment block!
In contrast with environment block, environment file is not a boot component
and is not used at boot time by any boot processes.
This file contains pairs
.B NAME=VALUE
delimited by new line symbols (i.e. each pair on a separate line).
.B NAME
is identified as a sequence of characters before the leftmost '=' in the line.
.B NAME
has to satisfy the requirements above. Lines beginning from "#" are ignored.
Lines with not identified
.B NAME
are ignored.

Namespaces in an environment file are specified by sections. Sections are
indicated by titles - lines, starting with a keyword '[site X]', where X is a
namespace ID. Rectangle brackets in any such keyword are mandatory. The word
"site" is case insensitive. Any keyword may be followed with a comment on the
same line. Any lines between neighboring section titles do form a section,
defined by the upper title. If the environment file doesn't begin from a
section title, then the area at the beginning, not indicated by a title,
defines the "common" namespace. Sections with identical titles are considered
as parts of the same "compound" section. If a section (simple or compound)
contains lines with identical names, then only the last one takes an effect.

If the file defines more than 512 effective values (summed over all sections)
or if all namespaces defined by that file don't fit to the environment block,
then
.B zipl(8)
will fail to import such file.

This file can be modified, using any suitable text editor.

.SH NOTES

Site namespace corresponds to a
.B fail-over site
which is a set of block devices, participating in hardware replication,
and used for planned/unplanned swap.

Any installed zIPL environment (environment block) should be accessed only
by this
.B zipl-editenv
tool. Using other ways to access the environment block is not allowed.

Any modification of installed zIPL environment block doesn't affect the
environment file. The user is responsible for keeping the environment file
up to date.
